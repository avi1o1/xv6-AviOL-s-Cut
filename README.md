# Intro to Xv6

## xv6
- Sometimes the usertest and schedulertest fail on the same code that it passed on one run ago. Looks like the tests are not deterministic.

- LBS breaks down randomly, when some unworking changes are made to code. and pertains for considerable time. but everything is back fine after make clean and re-making
